                        COME MEET OUR DOGS AT OUR WEEKEND SATELLITE ADOPTION EVENTS!

                        We have satellite adoption events every Saturday at PetSmart stores in Olathe and Wyandotte County. We also have satellite adoption events on Sundays at the Olathe store. Pets are allowed to be adopted and taken home directly from PetSmart. Visit our Petfinder home page http://kckac.petfinder.com for more information on this weekend's events. On Friday evenings we post the store location that each dog will be at on Saturday.

                        We also will do adoptions by appointment only from our shelter in KCK.

                        Our dogs have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and tested for heartworms (if 7 months or older). The adoption fee for males is $62 and for females it is $72.

                        For more information, please call us at 321-1445 or email jstewart@kckpd.org.</p>
